GitHub is a hub of .git/directories

you can push and pull  commits from github

you can clone repositories from github

Pull request are how you merge branches on github






master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initialize our depository.

HEAD is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit.

Head is *not* a branch

#creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git notes

# shows which branch is active
