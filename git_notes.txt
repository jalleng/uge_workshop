Master is the label on the stable branch.
We create another secondary branch to work on.
Head is the label on the active branch with the leading commit.
When we are happy with our changes we merge branches and delete the secondary branch.

GitHub is a hub of .git/directories

you can push and pull commits from github to local

you can clone repositories from github

Pull request are how you merge branches on github

master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initialize our depository.

HEAD is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit.

Head is *not* a branch

# creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git notes

# * shows which branch is active
git branch
